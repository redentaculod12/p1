The first motivation is the Lord giving me strength to surpass the circumstances 	
and my family that support me.

My study experience is like a mountain and valley a dark tunnel that cannot see anything
a mountain because I started in the lower part, and I didn't know anything about my course but,
knowing the truth that I don't know a thing is a big step to start learning new things 
that's why I start to climb and grind gaining and learning through experience.
a valley that is full of streams of water that even I do not have a tool to use,
specially gadgets to use in my course I keep stepping forward I start with a small piece of paper and writing tools
I start experimenting with things like trying what I learn from my teachers and expanding it by doing a research 
I know things that teach by the teacher are the basic things that we are the one that we need to the study 
and that my heavy streams of water and the mountains are the things in my head that make me anxious 
but I still keep focusing on my dreams.
I'm in the part of my life that cannot see a thing that I feel and ask myself "Can I surpass this thing? "
because it is like a dark tunnel that no exit not aware of what is the end I lose hope and I lose interest in things 
the things that do it alone and  no one can help, the thing I keep asking and no one can tell me the answer 
I don't have wisdom like others, but I keep chasing answers.
